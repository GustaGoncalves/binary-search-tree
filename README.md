# Binary Search Tree
A simple search binary search tree with insertion and deletion of elements from it I made during my third semester on college.

As stated in my profile, I really like pointers. A lot of people do not like them and when I mention this fact or looked like I was having a good time on the data structures class, I was given some hilarious looks.
And I am very serious with this, I really like pointers and creating raw structures from scratch like this, I even aced all my tests on it!

During classes, the teacher said we, unfortunately, would not have enough time to develop a fully fleged bynary tree, but I liked the whole thing so much that I simply started making one myself.
And so, over the course of about a week of raw, unfiltered code writing with many sprinkles of madness thrown all over the place and a whole load of testing, this is what I've managed to do.

I have plans to return to this tree and properly finish it with traversal, balacing and some proper clean-up and optimizing, but that is for the future since teachers this semester are all using Java and PHP for classes on software engineering and OOP.
For the present, this is how it will stand, although I may make a quick and simple menu so it can be actually used without having to change the code every single time.
